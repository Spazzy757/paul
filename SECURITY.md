# Security Policy

## Deployment of fixes

Pauls master branch is deployed to production so if the fix is in master you can assume that the fix is in production

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you find a Vulnerability in the code base, please create an issue specifying the Vulnerability and (if you are able) a fix for it. 
Vulnerabilities will take higher precedence over features. 


## Security Scanning

Paul makes use of Githubs Security Bot [Dependabot](https://dependabot.com/) to maintain security of the source code
